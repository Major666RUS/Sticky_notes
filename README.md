This is a small web application that lets you create, modify and save (in a client side) colored sticky notes.
I used React + vanilla JS for implementation. I decided to not use any building system to meet the general idea of this task - to avoid using readymade solutions. So I used babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js for using JSX without any compilation. I hope reviewers will understand why I did so.

You should click to the plus icon at the right bottom corner to create a new sticky note. You can edit a text message on it. You have an ability change the order of notes on the board dragging one of them to another one. You can remove any note dragging it to the trash zone at the left bottom corner. Also all notes are saved automatically in your browser's localStorage. No need to save any change manually.
